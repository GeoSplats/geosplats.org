                <p><strong>GeoSplat</strong> is a rendering technology utilizing an optimized data format to enable the
                    interactive, photo-realistic, high-fidelity visualization of extremely large 3D environments.</p>
                <p>The first public implementation, demonstrating its application on massive scenes (containing billions
                    of "splats") with streamable <strong>Levels of Detail (LODs)</strong> and the ability to compose
                    models from geographical tiles, similar to traditional satellite maps, was recently showcased. This
                    technology is designed to render in real-time within a web browser using <strong>WebGPU</strong>. It
                    was presented by <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/" rel="noopener">MapTiler</a> at
                    their <a href="https://connect.maptiler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect 25</a>
                    conference, featuring
                    demonstrations on models of San Francisco and Poland.</p>

                <p>This technology is fundamentally powered by <strong>Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)</strong>, a novel
                    method in 3D graphics, rendering, and computer vision. Instead of using traditional polygonal meshes
                    or point clouds, 3DGS represents and visualizes a scene using millions of tiny, learnable,
                    translucent ellipsoidsâ€”referred to as 3D Gaussians or "splats." This explicit representation allows
                    for state-of-the-art visual quality, including complex view-dependent effects, while maintaining the
                    computational efficiency required for real-time rendering.</p>

                <h2>User-Friendly and AI-Ready</h2>
                <p>Crucially, the explicit nature of the Gaussian Splatting data structure makes it uniquely
                    <strong>human-editable</strong> and highly <strong>compatible with Generative AI (GenAI)</strong>
                    approaches.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Editability</strong>: Unlike black-box neural network models, the discrete,
                        volumetric "splats" can be easily manipulated, moved, or deleted using standard 3D editing
                        tools, making it straightforward for artists and technicians to refine or correct geometric
                        features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generative AI Integration</strong>: The format is extremely friendly to GenAI models for
                        tasks like visual improvement, material correction, or generating complex edits directly from
                        text prompts (text-to-3D editing). This compatibility allows for rapid, sophisticated changes to
                        be applied directly to the 3D data, accelerating the creation and customization of massive
                        digital twin environments.</li>
